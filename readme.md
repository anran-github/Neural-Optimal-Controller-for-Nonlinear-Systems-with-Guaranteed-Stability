# Multi-Agent Source Code

The source code provide three models appeared in our paper:

## Numerical Experiments

## Heater System Study

## Drone Study

Relevant code are saved in separate folder.

* In particular, *each experiments includes **simulation** codes, one can use these simulation model to implement their control ideas.

* Both **Data Collection** ,**Training**, and **Validation** codes are also included in each experimental study.

*Feel free to cite our paper if you find this repo helped you:*
