# Single Heater System

The single heater system discrete-time state-space representation is:

$\begin{align}
x(t+1)=&\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -0.0005 \\
1 & -0.0965 
\end{array}\right] x(t)+\left[\begin{array}{c}
0.0004 \\
-0.00
\end{array}\right] u(t), \nonumber\\
y(t)=&\left[\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 1
\end{array}\right] x(t)+T_{amb.}, \nonumber\\
\end{align}$

where $T_{amb.}$ is ambient temperature.

If you want to compare your results with our heater system, this is a good demo.
## 
    heater_new_model_simulation

* Dynamic simulation with LQR control, Multi-Agent optimal control, and Neural Controller methods.

## Hardware Experiemnt:
## 

    heater_new_model_hardware.m

* The second section drow the paper figures:
(Need to load both .mat files.)
![Alt text](heater_res.png )

* The first second connects Arduino kit board, build transition with the heater system.


## Other Files
    heater_new_model_multi_agent_datacollection.m

* Used for data collection. 
* A little different from the method metioned in paper. This reference code shows data is collected every iterations given one reference $T_{desire}$.
##
    NN_heater_trajectories_simulation.py

* Verify the convergence for different trained NN models.
